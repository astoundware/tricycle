# Tricycle
Tricycle is an open-source video transcoder for macOS and Windows.  It takes the guesswork out of converting videos by using layman's terms and providing a reasonable default configuration.  Tricycle is powered by other open-source projects such as [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), [x264](https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html), and [x265](http://www.x265.org/).
